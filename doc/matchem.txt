Overview                                         *matchem-overview*

MatchEm is a vim plugin which auto adds closing quotes, parens, bracket,
curlies and other such characters as you type.  Using matchem doesn't involve
any change of behavior on your part. Simple type your code as you normally
would and matchem will handle auto adding closing quotes, etc as necessary and
overwriting them accordingly if you continue to manually type the closing
character.

While auto adding closing character seems like a simple feature, in practice
there are a lot of edge cases and matchem aims to clear address as many of
those as possible (and provide the means to inject your own edge case
handlers) so that you aren't interrupting your flow by correcting mistakes
made by the matcher.

Note: some of the matchem's edge case handling relies on vim's syntax
highlighting being enabled. If syntax highlighting is disabled, matchem will
degrade gracefully but may not handle some edge case.

  |matchpairs|

  To decide what characters to auto match, matchem uses vim's existing
  |matchpairs| option.

  *g:MatchemRepeatFixup* Default: 1

  When non-0 matchem will map each character found in the
  g:MatchemUndoBreakChars list in order to properly flush auto matched
  delimiters to keep vim's undo and repeat functionality happy. You probably
  wouldn't want to ever disable this setting.

  *g:MatchemExpandCr*  Default: 1

  When non-0 matchem will map <cr> in insert mode to auto add a blank line at
  the proper indentation level between open and close delimiters specified by 
  |g:MatchemExpandCrEndChars|.

  *g:MatchemExpandCrEndChars* Default: ['}', ']']

  List of end characters which when a preceding <cr> is typed will trigger
  matchem's exand cr support. Note that this variable can also be set at the
  buffer level using b:MatchemExpandCrEndChars.

  *g:MatchemMaxMatchSearchDepth* Default: 100

  When typing a closing delimiter (paren, bracket, curly) where that delimiter
  already exists after the cursor, matchem will walk up the file look at
  corresponding open delimiters to determine whether that delimiter should be
  inserted or whether the existing delimiter should be overwritten. This
  variable determines the maximum number of open delimiters to visit when
  determining the proper behavior.

  *g:MatchemEdgeCases* Default: <dictionary of built in edge case handlers>

  This setting provides a dictionary of file type key ('*' to indicate all
  file types) to a list of function names which will be invoked to handle file
  type specific edge cases. By default matchem provides some edge case
  handlers for perl, python, sh, vim, and html/php files, but you can create
  and add your own (look at the existing functions to get an idea of how they
  are written). You can also set this variable at the buffer level using
  b:MatchemEdgeCases.
